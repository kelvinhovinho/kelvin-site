        <h4>Education Background</h4>
        <P>I have gone throught the 8-4-4 Kenyan education system.</P>
        <h4>Primary Education</h4>
        <p>I went to Baraton Primary School in nandi county where i did my primary school education.
            I joined the school from my pre-unit classes to standard eight(8) where i did my kenya 
            certificate of primary education (K.C.P.E) in the year 2008. i attained 260(C+) out of possibly 500 marks.
        </p>
        <h4>Secondary school Education</h4>

            school education. I did my Kenya Certificate Of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) and i attained

        <h4>Why Programming?</h4>
        <p>One of the major reasons i decided to join programming was because i have passion in developing sysytem.
            back in campus we were not taught enough and learning programming by my own was a challenge because i coukd
            not understand what it takes and i lacked a steward to guide me.
